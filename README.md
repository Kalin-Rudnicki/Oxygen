# Oxygen

You can't survive without oxygen, and you can't survive as a scala dev without the `Oxygen` library.

`Oxygen` has everything from helpful little extension methods `.some`/`.asRight`,
to macro utilities that help you with metaprogramming, with much more on the way!

The end goal of this library is being able to deploy a web-app to production only needing to use tools directly provided by Oxygen.
